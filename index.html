			<h3>Sizes</h3>
			<p>The most common size of film is 35mm. This is the cassette that everyone thinks of when they think of film. But there is also medium format film, which is 6cm wide and sometimes comes with a paper backing. APS film which is smaller than 35mm. There is also sheet film which can be 4x5 inches or even larger and comes in sheets like paper instead of on a roll. The size of the film dictates the resolution of your final image.</p>

			<h3>Types</h3>
			<p>The most common film type is color negative or C-41 film. But there is also black and white negative film which I mentioned earlier for its extreme latitude. And there is slide film (also called chrome or E6) which creates a positive color image. You might be familiar with this type of film if you've ever seen old slides that were shown with a projector. Slide film has a latitude similar to that of digital cameras, but it can produce a very high quality, high resolution image. It also reproduces vivid colors brilliantly.</p>

			<h3>Speeds</h3>
			<p>Film speeds range from 100 to 3200 typically. Film speed is often expressed as an ISO setting and many advanced digital cameras allow you to change this setting in a digital way. Film speed really has nothing to do with speed - it would be more appropriate to call it film sensitivity. 100 speed film is "slow" or not very sensitive, it needs a lot of light to make an exposure. 3200 speed film is "fast" or very sensitive.</p>
