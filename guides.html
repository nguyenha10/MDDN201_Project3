			<h3>Use light meter</h3>
			<img src="img/film101tips_1.jpg">
			<p>I used a simple 35mm film camera and utilized the internal reflected light meter in the camera. You can absolutely do this, but getting to know and trust a handheld incident light meter is so crucial when truly trying to learn the ins and outs of exposure</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Stick one film stock</h3>
			<img src="img/film101tips_2.jpg">
			<p>The internet is full of photographers who recommend trying out different film stocks until you find one you like. There are also tons of photographers who also believe you should just pick one, shoot it for about a year and then decision to switch to another. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="g-30">
			<h3>Start with 35mm film first</h3>
			<img src="img/film101tips_3.jpg">
			<p>With 35mm, you get about 36 exposures, (you can buy rolls with less exposures too).  The cost of one roll of 120 might be slightly cheaper than a roll of 35mm, but the cost per frame is cheaper for 35mm.  This also goes for developing as well. </p>
		</div>

			<h3>Use a professional lab to develop</h3>
			<img src="img/film101tips_4.jpg">
			<p>many labs provide you with feedback (only from a technical aspect) on each roll they develop. There is an additional cost for the feedback, but it is super helpful when starting off.  It took me a while to find a lab I liked, but here are two labs I have used and can completely vouch for: the filmlab</p>

			<h3>Keep a journal to document</h3>
			<img src="img/film101tips_5.jpg">
			<p>The most common size of film is 35mm. This is the cassette that everyone thinks of when they think of film. But there is also medium format film, which is 6cm wide and sometimes comes with a paper backing. APS film which is smaller than 35mm. There is also sheet film which can be 4x5 inches or even larger and comes in sheets like paper instead of on a roll. The size of the film dictates the resolution of your final image.</p>

			<h3>Sunny 16 rules</h3>
			<img src="img/film101tips_6.jpg">
			<p>The Sunny 16 Rule is a way to meter for correct exposure during daylight without using the camera's meter. So for example, if your ISO is 200 at f/16, then your shutter speed will be 1/200 seconds. If your ISO is 100, then your shutter speed will be 1/100 seconds.</p>
